# call-apply-and-bind
Understanding Call, Apply and Bind by creating them - Javascript


##A quick run down of what each method does
1. Call invokes the function immediately and allows you to pass in arguments one by one
2. Apply invokes the function immediately and allows you to pass in arguments as an array.
3. Bind returns a new function, and you can invoke/call it anytime you want by invoking a function.
